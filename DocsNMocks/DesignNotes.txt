Not done yet! Let's do the following:
DO THIS: have it so cancel in-game goes to the menu
DO THIS: do conditional compile for droid (and ios?) that puts up drop and exit buttons in game and main menu 
  I guess call it a Fire button, and put it where? Next to the screen on the right, say, and the drop button is next to the
  screen on the left.
- Once got that working, send to Dad and see if it'll work on his tablet and phone.

So basically, platform-dependent input.

Turns out you can't simulate touch in the editor with a mouse - how do you do multitouch? But people have written fakes for single touch.

My first attempt at a solution totally didn't work, dunno why. Trying the approach on http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/652927/touch-input-on-sprites.html

moved the sky back to avoid z errors on android.

Installing android stuff n java on takkun - might do so on parappa, too, if I decide it as the powerful puter is the one to use for builds.

OK - that all worked finally after I got a few rounds of this:

CommandInvokationFailure: Failed to re-package resources. See the Console for details.
G:\android-sdk-windows\build-tools\24.0.0-preview\aapt.exe package --auto-add-overlay -v -f -m -J gen -M AndroidManifest.xml -S "res" -I "G:/android-sdk-windows\platforms\android-23\android.jar" -F bin/resources.ap_

And then I uninstalled the preview build tools and everything worked fine. Copied the takkun-built GropZoneTestv3b.apk to drive.

And yay! It's hitchy but worky on the tableet

5/18b
YAY the counters basically work!
The digit sprites look a bit wonky and can rope in pieces of the neighboring ones. I will fiddle their borders to avoid.

AND NOW IT LOOKS AWESOME

about all that's left is to do 
DONE: Plane speed increase for high scores
DONE: sky
DONE: wood grain
DONE: Game over check - once done, scrub all the sprites, wait a second, blip back to menu scene.

NEXT UP:
- starting instructions / ui stuff - I created a MenuScene which looks just like MainScene but for Floor.
  I think tttd is to put some instructions up on that, really basic, then swap to MainScene
  Have scores shown behind tape so (blue grop) = 1 point is under blue tape, etc.
DONE: Esc at main menu drops out of the game.
- DON'T FORGET THE STICKERS - Maybe just put the counters up?
AND THAT SHOULD BE THAT

5/18
Very blurrily on the flyer scan it looks like the stickers say SCORE and 
 BOMBS
DROPPED

in nice blocky no-nonsense sans serif. I think I'll go with SHOES LEFT and count down.

Need to do the fancy blue gradient sky too

And actually the audio lag on my phone isn't so bad. Need to try the tablet.

So do I really want these to be Sprite-style texture? They have to be, to use the sprite editor. Lemme see what I can do with 'em

OK, now I've used the sprite editor to cut it up into Digit_0 through Digit_9 plus Sticker_Score and Sticker_Shoes.

ALSO snagged WoodFine0016_M.jpg from textures.com which should be a good simulated wood grain texture.

So why not try to make a class called CounterPrefab that has a tens digit, a ones digit, a sticker, and all it does is sit there showing a 2-digit number.

Mocked it up for score and shoes, and the score one has a top level transform of -4.4, 2 
Tens is 0,0 relative to it - I think I'll get rid of that level of hierarchy and just put the digit sprites directly in
Ones is 0.65, 0 relative to it
Sticker is -0.028, -0.609

Shoes main xform is -4.4, 0.7
Digits same relative
Sticker .599, -.886

5/17b
Created NumberSprites.png, which will hold the digits for score and shoe count and then there'll be some more room for the stickers that have the words
"score" and "shoes" on them (and which go on the same layer as the bezel and block everything. They can be bigger than 64x64, of course)
DIGITS SHOULD HAVE SOME SPACE IN BETWEEN so auto sprite cutter can find them all
Do I want to use sprites?

Well, I made numbers. Still need stickers. Do nice fake edge with two black edges and two white edges, maybe a little peely

5/17: Android build works great, but sound lags

- maybe see this http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/android-sound-latency-fix.319943/ - original link is dead so I put AudioFixPluginForAndroid.zip in DocsNMocks

Or this https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/35295

5/16
Downloaded the dexed DX7 emulator - saved in UnityResearch, which I need to back up - see if it works in audacity! Copied the DLL to 
Audacity's plugins dir. But drat, looks like these VSTi things aren't supported.
Found some other plugins at http://free-loops.com/free-synths-vsts.html

And grabbed the psycle music thing - Dexed works in that!
ANd I grabbed what claims to be 3000 presets from http://www.themusicproducerblog.com/2014/12/yamaha-dx7-dexed-plugin-3000-soundbanks.html
file called DX7_AllTheWeb.zip - not sure re: legal status tho, looks like it came from here http://bobbyblues.recup.ch/yamaha_dx7/dx7_patches.html
where the guy says he got them all for free online and invites anyone who owns them to say they're not OK.
Tim Garrett /YAMEFX has the "St. Helens" one I remember

Searching "explosion" on Freesound turned up some goodies. I'd rather have a splat, but wev - here are a few nice ones
https://www.freesound.org/people/Aiwha/sounds/250712/
https://www.freesound.org/people/jobro/sounds/35460/ (shorten and stuff, nice and synthy, attribution license)
https://www.freesound.org/people/Nbs%20Dark/sounds/94185/ (Good solid noisy short explosion, sounds like something you'd hear from an old cabinet - cc0)
https://www.freesound.org/people/Apenguin73/sounds/335152/ (percussive, needs a shorter tail, cc0)
https://www.freesound.org/people/killkhan/sounds/150210/ (synthy and gamey, not for commercial use)

So I saved that third one as 94185__nbs-dark__explosion.wav in DocsNMocks and will fiddle it up to be like I want.

ACTUALLY I SEARCHED FOR FART ON FREESOUND AND FOUND A FINE ONE - https://www.freesound.org/people/timtube/sounds/61046/ - attribution, noncommercial. Good "dude you beefed" but also plausibly a splatter
https://www.freesound.org/people/oldedgar/sounds/97979/ is cc0, editing down a bit could work
Grabbed as 97979__oldedgar__raspberry.aif
Made a short sample, raspberry.wav


5/15b
Got the grops moving! I guess now I need to make them get hit n stuff
AND NOW THEY DO!
Should do something like switch the texture to splatter instead of disappear

Oh yeah, we need sound

- created the pish noise in Audacity and imported into the project and made an AudioSourcePishPrefab out of it.
Will have to see if that's how you do it!

ooh neat https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike/audio has some simple stuff in a singleton that does some little
Wwise-like things like a randomize container - ok, well, just that.
COOL THAT PARAMS KEYWORD IS A SORT OF VARARGS THING 

But I pulled that cs in as SoundManager.cs, just discarded their namespace thing.

I assume I can only play one sfx at a time under this scheme?

Re: free sfx looks like there are a lot of sites, and maybe some Audacity plugins I could get - check this thing http://www.bfxr.net/

5/15:
Getting Game Manager hooked up - currently plane almost works, shoe doesn't. FIGURE OUT!

And further, but trigger isn't triggering. If I make the floor non-trigger and bouncy, the shoe bounces.

http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/815221/ontriggerenter-not-being-called.html

Which sez http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html has a list of type-type collision interactions.
Rigidbody collider and static trigger collider is what I have and should work

OH BUT IF YOU USE THE 2D PHYSICS AND COLLIDER STUFF YOU HAVE TO USE THE 2D VERSIONS OF THE ONTRIGGERENTER N STUFF.

So next up: Grops.

We should start with none on the screen, and they come in from the sides. Each grop is sort of like the plane - starts off screen,
moves until it reaches its max/min (depending on direction) x coord - then, I guess, gets destroyed? Not sure.
Have to make it so there are never more than 2 grops on each row and their spacing is right.

I guess could just track the position of each grop, whether or not the grop actually exists, perhaps in the game manager. When it comes time for
a non-existing grop to appear at its initial location, create one there; if an existing one has moved to its furthest location, destroy it.

And of course if one is hit by a shoe, do whatever happens (inc score, destroy the grop)

5/14:
Stuff is basically starting to work - I still might make it all 3D quads instead of sprites so as to make it easier to scale everything to 
fit, or something. The Physics2D should still work, yes?

It seems to work to make the quads have the same aspect ratio as the sprite artwork, then just put the sprite art on there.
Plane art is 160x90, 1.778 -
Grop is 230x90, 2.556

For some reason texture compression needs the art to be scaled to 4-pixel aligned sizes - but I can just create them that way later.


5/12/16: OK, so. Looking at the old Drop Zone 4 flyer, I'd guess the screen is divided into 8 rows.
The plane occupies the top one, the targets the bottom three.
I'm mocking up in 1024x768 but should maybe mock up in 1920 x 1080, or perhaps 720p
K so now they're 1280x720
I also wanted to make a cutout thingy that looked like the roundy edges of an old TV. That should occupy the inset 4x3 in the center.
Which is 960x720.
The top and bottom row should be covered up just a little bit by this, maybe, or better space them up a little - say use the 853x640 centered in it.
Have it so the whole screen is clear of the bezel, then.
OK, so I have a bezel.png in MocksNDocs that is a simple grey bezel shape.
That should be the topmost thing in the scene, then the color tape sprites - and IIRC the way to handle them on PS1 was to have them subtract yellow instead of adding blue, etc.
Have to see if I can do that. 
Layers:
top: bezel
middle: colored tape
lower middle: score and number of bombs left
bottom: sprites

Oh hey and Donald in testing said that there are a jillion youtube vids and tutorials out there to teach you Unity.
