# GropZone4
Small Unity project about dropping shoes on grasshoppers from a great height, 1974-style!

[More detail on the wiki!](https://github.com/SamWibatt/GropZone4/wiki)

Currently in initial upload state - *should* be everything needed to build the game in a mid-2016 installation of Unity on Windows.
